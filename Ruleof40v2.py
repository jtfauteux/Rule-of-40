Rule of 40 Stock Screener
***Stanford Code In Place final project***

The "Rule of 40" in finance, is a benchmark that suggests a healthy company's
combined annual revenue growth rate and profit margin should equal or exceed 40%.
This threshold was popularized as a benchmark to assess a company's financial health
and potential, balancing growth with profitability.

This program will calculate the "rule of 40" value for all S&P 500 stocks.
Only the stocks that are above or equal to 40% will be displayed.
If there is missing data from Yahoo and the calculation cannot be completed
then the stock ticker and missing data message is displayed.

The program was run and tested using the PyCharm IDE so that additional libraries
could be installed. It is not possible to install these libraries in the Code In Place IDE.
This program uses the financial data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance library)
